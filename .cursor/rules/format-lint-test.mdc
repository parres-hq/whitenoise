## Formatting and Linting

You should always use the `just check-clippy` and `just check-fmt` commands to check for linter errors and formatting issues. Please DO NOT run `cargo clippy` or `cargo fmt` directly.

## Running tests

You should always use the `just test` command to run tests.

## Running all checks

You should always use the `just precommit` command to run all three (clippy, formatting, and tests).
