# Integration Test

There is a file at [integration_test.rs](mdc:src/bin/integration_test.rs) that performs a full integration test across multiple features. This integration test should ALWAYS be run with the `just int-test` command and should not be run on its own with different log and data directories. The `int-test` recipe also enables the `integration-tests` Cargo feature.
