# White Noise

A secure, private, and decentralized chat app built on Nostr, using the MLS protocol under the hood.

## Overview

White Noise aims to be the most secure private chat app on Nostr, with a focus on privacy and security. Under the hood, it uses the [Messaging Layer Security](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html) (MLS) protocol to manage group communications in a highly secure way. Nostr is used as the transport protocol and as the framework for the ongoing conversation in each chat.

This crate is the core library that powers our Flutter app. It is front-end agnostic and will allow for CLI and other interfaces to operate groups in the future.

## Status

## The Spec

White Noise is an implementation of the [NIP-EE](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/EE.md) spec.

## Building White Noise Yourself

White Noise is a standard rust crate. Check it out and use it like you would any other crate.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/parres-hq/whitenoise.git` and `cd whitenoise`.

In addition, there are extensive integration tests in the codebase that run through much of the API and functions. Run it with the following

```sh
just int-test
```

Check formatting, clippy, and docs with the following:

```sh
just check
```

Check all those things and run tests with `precommit`

```sh
just precommit
```

## Contributing

To get started contributing you'll need to have the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain installed (version 1.90.0 or later) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/parres-hq/whitenoise.git` and `cd whitenoise`.
1. Install recommended development tools: `just install-tools` (optional but recommended)
1. Start the development services (two Nostr relays; nostr-rs-relay and strfry, and a blossom server):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   Or if using older Docker versions:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
1. Now you can run the integration tests with `just int-test`.

### Development Tools

We recommend installing additional cargo tools for enhanced development experience:

```sh
just install-tools
```

This installs:
- **cargo-nextest**: Faster parallel test runner
- **cargo-audit**: Security vulnerability scanner
- **cargo-outdated**: Check for outdated dependencies
- **cargo-llvm-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **cargo-msrv**: Verify minimum Rust version
- **cargo-deny**: License and dependency checker
- **cargo-expand**: Macro expansion tool

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS.md) for detailed usage instructions.

### Formatting, Linting, and Tests

Before submitting PRs, please run the `precommit` command:

```sh
just precommit
```

Or for a quicker check (without integration tests):

```sh
just precommit-quick
```

Available development commands:

```sh
just check           # Run format, clippy, and doc checks
just fmt             # Format code
just test            # Run all tests (uses nextest if available)
just test-cargo      # Force cargo test (slower)
just coverage        # Generate coverage report
just audit           # Security audit
just outdated        # Check for outdated dependencies
just deny-check      # Check licenses and dependencies
```

### Test Coverage

**Prerequisites**: Docker must be running for coverage tests.

```bash
# Start required services
docker compose up -d

# Generate coverage
just coverage        # Generate lcov.info report
just coverage-html   # Generate HTML report

# View HTML report
open target/llvm-cov/html/index.html
```

Coverage is automatically tracked in CI as part of the test suite. PRs that decrease coverage will be blocked.
